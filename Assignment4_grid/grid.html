                            I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the
                            best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                            the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a

                        programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                        The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on
                        and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular,
                        was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
                        have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
                        experience.
                        It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
